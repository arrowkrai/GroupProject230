todo:
- BLOB data type not working with UI, either fix or change account data type
- insert form (include js data validation, if db throws error, show user)
- update button on each row (should fill out form for user but button calls update method)
- delete button on each row (include are you sure prompt)

if have time:
- conditions (where, having, order by, group by, etc...)
- limit rows shown to user (with option to set row amount)
